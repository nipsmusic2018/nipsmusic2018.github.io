## Overview

For the [NIPS 2018 Conference](https://nips.cc) in Montreal, the
organizers have decided to hold an open call for musicians and VJs to perform
at the Banquet. Selected acts will be posted here once decisions are
made. **This call is only open to those who are registered for NIPS 2018.** We
are unfortunately unable to provide registrations via this call.

## Call for Particiaption

Do you perform music or visuals (VJing) and are you registered for NIPS?  If so, please
consider submitting a sample of your work to our NIPS 2018 Call for
Performances. If you are selected, you will be invited to perform onstage
at the official NIPS Banquet alongside other researchers from the NIPS
community and, perhaps, some surprise invited guests!


Based on the submissions we receive, a selection committee will build
a sequence of diverse acts ranging from the quiet to the loud. We
define “music” as broadly as possible! Anything that makes your hips
move, engages your mind, and/or tickles your eardrums. VJ sets are
also invited, we will try to fit VJs to the music they best suit.
Our goal is to produce an evening of engaging, diverse
researcher-generated music as a fun backdrop for the NIPS Banquet.

To submit, please send an email to **nips2018music@gmail.com** addressing
the following:

1. The researcher(s) who will perform, can be individual acts (that
may be grouped with other musicians) or complete bands/groups. You
must all be registered for NIPS 2018.

2. A link to performance samples. We’re interested in any evidence of
what you’ll perform (YouTube videos of previous performances,
SoundCloud audio examples, etc).

3. Any details you want to add about why your performance belongs at
NIPS. We want to tell a story about the deep musical talent of the
NIPS Research community.

4. Any equipment needed for your performance. We plan to provide basic
gear as needed (PA, drums, guitars, projection for VJ sets, etc.) and
will try to accommodate more esoteric requests, but have limited
resources.

Deadline for submissions is **Monday November 12th at 9:00AM Pacific
time**, leaving a few weekends to pull this together (we hope it’s fun).
